# travelmanSpain
Travelling Salesman optimization problem (Spanish mainland cities version), simulated annealing approach.

This code looks for solutions to the travelling salesman problem using the Simulated Annealing algorithm
This version works out solutions for the Spanish case (spanish cities, distances are in kilometers)
A nice TODO would be to draw the solution using the city coordinates
